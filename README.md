# Leet-Code-practice
fun coding problems / brain excercise.

Today, I learned an important lesson. 💡 Here are the  important steps  you need to take before you start coding a LeetCode problem:  

1. Read & critically think about the problem. 🤔  
2. If working with a friend (or interviewer), discuss the solution and walk them through your thought process. 🗣️  
3. Don't be afraid to ask questions! ❓  
4. Draw things out and write the solution in plain English first. ✍️  
5. Write pseudocode and then convert that into actual code. 📝➡️💻  
6. When you have a working solution, think about optimizing it! ⚡  
7. Viola, you are done, and you did an amazing job if you followed these steps! 🎉  

Hope this helps! 🚀🔥 Take a look at the attached screenshot of me and my friends solving a leet code problem.
